*Watch Youtube videos offline.*

# Why?

There are a few reasons as to why you would rather use this service rather than
Youtube:

* *Privacy* - You may not particularly want Youtube to know what you are or are
not watching.
* *Lightweight* - Having even just a handful of Youtube tabs open can be very
heavy on RAM and CPU.
* *Distraction* - This service offers nothing but a video to be watched.

## Use Case

The following is the expected average use of this service:

1. User opens a Youtube video in a new browser tab.
2. An installed browser plug-in (left undefined) redirects the URL to this
service.
3. The service adds the video to a backlog and downloads it to be viewed.
4. The user views the video from this service, rather than Youtube.
